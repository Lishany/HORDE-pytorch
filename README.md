##Re-implementation of HORDE (harmonized representation learning on dynamic EHR)
Here is the PyTorch version for re-implementation of HORDE

### Data Description
data directory: ./data/
Data structure: list of quads (patient id, visit id, list of events in the visit, list of concepts in the visit)

### Run model
*run process_data.py*:  Pre-process data and obtain ctxpairs.npy (edges in graph), patients.npy (training data) and testpatients.npy (test data)
*run main.py*: train and test model
